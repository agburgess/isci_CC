This article makes three broad claims throughout it (FOSADMIN, 2020). First, that we have much more than seven years prior to reaching a 1.5 °C increase in temperature (FOSADMIN, 2020). Second, that the proportion of energy produced by renewable sources is much less than the 27.76% stated by the climate clock (FOSADMIN, 2020). Third, that the increase in temperature is financially lucrative and rather than being mitigated, should be encouraged (FOSADMIN, 2020).

To address the first point, that we have much more than seven years before reaching a 1.5°C increase in temperature, this is technically true, if only in the loosest possible sense. The Climate Clock is based on the carbon clock created by the Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) (Golan et al., 2021). They state that even if the carbon budget for staying below 1.5°C is used up, this may not necessarily correspond to a 1.5°C increase in temperature at a set point in time (Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, 2021). Among other reasons, this could be due to the fact that there is a time lag between the carbon budget running out and the temperature changing (Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, 2021). 

It may also be true that the proportion of energy created by renewable sources is less than the 27.7% stated by the climate clock. One estimate by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) is that in 2018, renewables worldwide formed 26.2% of the total energy production (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2017). This is a fault of the climate clock as the creators do not state exactly what they quantify as energy production, which would change the percentage depending on how strict their criteria are; nor do they quantify what constitutes a ‘renewable’; nor do they state where they are receiving their data from (Golan et al., 2021). This does not make the claim correct, as the authors pick their information very carefully in order to make their point, citing a report from BP which ostensibly supports their point (BP, 2020). If you look carefully though, this is incredibly misleading as this section reports only the percentage of renewables used as fuel and not all energy production (BP, 2020). This accounts for the huge discrepancy between the C2ES estimate and the first estimate presented in this claim. The claim then goes on to describe a secondary estimate accounting for solely the production of electricity, again this is inaccurate as this only considers electricity and not all methods of energy production. 

To address the third point of the claim, it is possible that with the changing climate, novel areas of business will open with the potential of being extremely lucrative (Hulme, 2009). For example, certain agri-biotech companies have filed patents for ‘climate crops’ which have been genetically engineered to thrive under climate change conditions (Hulme, 2009). However, the cost of mitigation strategies greatly outweighs the potential gains of allowing climate change to continue (Fawzy et al., 2020).

Overall, this claim draw from dubiously credible sources for their information, and while some of their arguments do hold a certain amount of truth, this seems to be more a case of happenstance rather through any real amount of skill that they have happened upon the truth. The primary paper cited in the post is not from a peer-reviewed journal, rather it is written by someone affiliated with notable climate deniers ‘Friends of Science’. There is an obvious bias in the piece, highlighted by the sources the author chooses to use. Though the arguments are plausible, there are notable flaws in the logic used to discuss them.
